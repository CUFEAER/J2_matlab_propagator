# J2\_matlab\_propagator

A repository with all what you need to propagate satellite locations and track/modify or even model your own satellites with.

This is mainly a student project that we did in school. It is used to propagate satellites from TLE files (which you can find online anywhere) with a twist. Our program mainly works in MATLAB's command window. Where you could design your satellite with various methods like addind classical orbital elements or position (r) and velocity (v) vectors. At least in v1.0. This is bound to be improved in the future.
